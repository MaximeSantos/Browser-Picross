# Browser Picross

Just having fun creating a Picross/Nonogram app in the browser as a good opportunity for me to mess around with SvelteKit.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram

The goal is for the app to have a small, probably mostly handmade, catalogue of puzzles for everyone to enjoy.
Registered users should have the ability to create new puzzles.
Admins should have the ability to manage how they are catalogued/sorted on the website.

## Some ideas :

- Be able to export puzzles to certain formats directly to the user's local machine.

- Save users progression/history.

- Allow for keyboard control on the gameboard.
