# Browser Picross

Just having fun creating a Picross/Nonogram app in the browser as a good opportunity for me to mess around with SvelteKit..

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram

The goal is for the app to have a small, probably mostly handmade, catalogue of puzzles for everyone to enjoy.
Admins should have the ability to create and store new puzzles directly from the app, as well as manage how they are catalogued/sorted on the website.

The app should be clean, minimalist and ergonomic.

## Some ideas :

- Be able to export puzzles to certain formats directly to the user's local machine.

- Save users progression (+ time ?) once the catalogue is more complete.

- Allow for keyboard control
